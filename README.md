# ASLTutor

90% of deaf children are born to hearing families. This makes it increasingly difficult for parents of deaf children to learn how to communicate with their children as they may not be familiar with American Sign Language(ASL). However, the amount of resources online to learn ASL is limited as it is difficult to determine exactly how someone is moving their hands or fingers in a video. 

ASLTutor is an application that will be created using the Leap Motion Sensor and the game development application Unity. Users will be able to use the Leap Moton sensor to perform a ASL sign and be given feedback on how they can improve. The Leap Motion Sensor uses two infrared cameras to detect hand movements and report hand, finger, and wrist positions. Functionalities the Leap Motion Unity development SDK will be used to either give feedback or validate that a user has repeated a sign correctly.
